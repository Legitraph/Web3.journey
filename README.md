Updates on my web3 journey.....

👋 Hi, I'm Ebubechukwu

I'm a self-taught developer currently learning Fullstack Web Development and diving deep into the Web3 ecosystem — one day, one repo at a time.

🚀 My Mission

I’m on a mission to become a full-time Web3 developer by the end of this year. I’m learning and building in public to stay accountable and help others starting from scratch — just like I did.

    ⚛️ React, Node.js, Express
    
    🛢️ MongoDB
    
    🔐 Web3 fundamentals (wallets, smart contracts, dApps)
    
    💻 Solidity + Remix + Ethers.js

🔨 Projects

Project Description
