<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm am Aghachi Ebubechukwu, A computer science undergraduate and upcoming web developer who is venturing into the web3 space. This is my first HTML website(obviously not) moreover this is the first HTML website I built using the knowledge from Angela Yu's course, It is needed for certification. I will be developing and posting a lot here so stay tuned not to miss out.</p>

<p>This document says about me so it will be good that I say a little about myself. I am a young individual aspiring to create the best out of my individual will power. I am fascinated by those who have and always eager to listen or here from them. In our common world people who have such attributes are often referred to as "Narcissist". I do not let the opinions of those who I do not look up to affect my inner self because people will always have something to say.I am a Christian and I believe that I can do everything through Christ who strengthens me. I also love football it has been a huge part of my life and taught me a lot of lessons in life.</p>

<p>In summary I would leave this for you all who are starting something big, for those who are termed as "Delusional" for chasing after their goals, Nothing is impossible, "If you can envision it in your mind and have the courage to speak it, it will surely happen"-Conor Mcgregor</p>
